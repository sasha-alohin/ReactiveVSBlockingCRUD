# ReactiveVSBlockingCRUD
The main purpose of the project was to investigate performance of CRUD operations based on blocking and non-blocking operations with Spring 5. For this purpose there were chosen MongoRepository and ReactiveMongoRepository. Application was running on server and load testing performed on local machine with Apache Jmeter. Based on results, i can say that operations with reactive style were performed a little bit faster than in non-reactive semantic. Files with test result atached to repository.
